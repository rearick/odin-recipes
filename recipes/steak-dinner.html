        <h2>Odin's Review</h2>

        <p>
            Mortal chefs, hear my praise! I have savored a meal of celestial proportions:
            a succulent steak, perfectly cooked and seasoned, accompanied by crisp
            asparagus, golden potatoes, and a rich, velvety gravy. This feast was fit for
            the halls of Valhalla, a culinary masterpiece that rivals the feasts of the
            gods. The flavors were harmonious, each component complementing the other in
            a symphony of taste. From the first bite to the last, it was an experience
            that transcended mortal cuisine. I urge all who seek true culinary excellence
            to partake in such a feast—a meal that would surely be welcomed even by the
            gods themselves.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Pro-Tip: It’s All About The Seasoning</h3>

        <p>
            When it comes to cooking the perfect steak, it’s all about preparation and patience. Season your
            steaks with salt on both sides, along with fresh ground pepper, and let them rest in the
            refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours if possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            This little trick allows the salt to tenderize the meat, leading to a more flavorful and tender
            steak. If you’re short on time, even an hour’s worth of seasoning before cooking can make a
            significant difference. Remember, a well-seasoned steak is the foundation of a great meal.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the potatoes, don’t be afraid to get a little fancy without complicating things. A simple
            cookie cutter can transform ordinary potatoes into elegant, circular masterpieces that are sure
            to impress.
        </p>

        <p>
            Keep them soaked in water until you’re ready to cook to prevent browning, and dry them
            thoroughly for that perfect, crispy exterior. Remember, presentation matters just as much as taste
            when it comes to serving up an unforgettable meal.
