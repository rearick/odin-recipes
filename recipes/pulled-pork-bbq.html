        <h2>Odin's Review</h2>

        <p>
            Mortal chefs, hear my praise! I've savored a celestial feastâ€”a pulled pork that rivals the
            hall of Valhalla's finest. Crafted by
            <a href="https://www.meatchurch.com/blogs/recipes/no-wrap-pork-butt-pulled-pork"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meat Church BBQ</a>,
            this pork butt, smoked to perfection with their signature blend of rubs and spices, is a
            culinary marvel. The bark, a thing of beauty, crackles with each bite, while the
            succulent meat melts on the tongue. This dish embodies the essence of BBQ: slow-cooked,
            tender, and bursting with flavor. No sauce required, for the seasoning alone is enough
            to elevate this dish to godly status. I urge all who seek culinary greatness to partake
            in this divine feast.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 bone in pork butt. 8-10 lbs.</li>
            <li>Meat Church Holy Voodoo (sub Honey Hog, Honey Bacon, Gospel Holy Gospel or Deez Nuts)</li>
            <li>1 T, yellow mustard for slather</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Prepare your Smoker</h3>

                <p>
                    Prepare your smoker at a temperature of 200 degrees. I recommend a medium smoke wood
                    for this cook such as hickory or pecan. We used a Traeger Timberline XL with Meat
                    Church pellets which is a blend of oak and hickory in this
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/D5meFHS1TAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Pork butt prep</h3>

                <p>
                    Remove all excess fat from the pork butt only leaving minimal fat on the bottom,
                    although this is not that important as you can remove it after the cook if you desire.
                    In this
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/D5meFHS1TAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>
                    we removed all the fat so we could build maximum bark. In other methods I often just
                    score the fat. The choice is yours.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Season the pork butt</h3>

                <p>
                    Slather the pork butt in yellow mustard to act as a binder for the seasoning. This
                    will not affect the flavor. Rather, it allows the seasoning to adhere more quickly.
                    Season all sides of the pork liberally with Holy Voodoo. Allow the pork butt to
                    allow let the seasoning fully adhere.  Allow at least 30 minutes but you can also
                    do that over night.

                <h3>Smoke the pork butt</h3>

                <p>This low and slow cook should take around 12 hours or so depending on weight</p>

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Place the pork butt in the smoker</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Smoke until 175-180 internal</p>
                        
                        <p>
                            You can spritz occasionally with cider vinegar if you like, but in this
                            <a href="https://youtu.be/D5meFHS1TAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>
                            we left for the day and didn't do a thing to the pork while it cooked. It took 10
                            hours for our pork butt to reach 180 internal.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Increase the temp of your smoker to 275 (+ or - to your preference)</p>
                        
                        <p>Continue smoking until the pork butt is probe tender which should be just over 200 internal temperature.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Pull the pork butt</h3>
                
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        <p>Remove the pork butt from the smoker and allow to rest</p>

                        <p>The haters will say it's burned. It's not.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Pull the pork</li>
                    <li>Add more seasoning of choice to enchance the flavor</li>
                    <li>Add sauce if you like</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
